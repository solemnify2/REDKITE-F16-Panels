# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Teensy 4.1-based USB joystick controller for the F-16 left console. Covers ECM, ELEC, EPU, AVTR, UHF backup radio, ENGINE START (JFS), MPO, and AUDIO 1/2. Supports Falcon BMS (BMS-BIOS) and DCS World (DCS-BIOS) with automatic protocol detection for LED synchronization. Part of the Redkite Project.

## Build & Upload

- **IDE**: Arduino IDE with [Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html)
- **Board**: Teensy 4.1
- **USB Type**: Serial + Keyboard + Mouse + Joystick
- **PID**: `0x048E` (set in `usb_desc.h`)
- **JOYSTICK_SIZE**: **64** — 58 buttons exceeds the 32-button limit of size 12. Both sketches in this repo now use 64, so `usb_desc.h` no longer needs editing between builds.
- **Upload**: Open `F16_LEFT_CONSOLE.ino` in Arduino IDE and Upload

## Architecture

### Data-Driven Hardware Configuration

All hardware is declared in config arrays under the **HARDWARE CONFIGURATION** section. To add/remove hardware, only edit these arrays:

- `mcpDevices[]` — MCP23017 I2C expanders (addr 0x20–0x27)
- `switches[]` — digital switches, direct or MCP (`mcpIdx = -1` means direct Teensy pin)
- `encoders[]` — rotary encoders (direct pins only)
- `pots[]` — potentiometers mapped to joystick axes (direct ADC pins only)
- `analogBtnArrays[]` — resistor ladder groups (ECM 8-button — T40 A0 / T41 A3)
- `leds[]` — ELEC panel LEDs, indexed by `LedIdx` enum
- `ecmSrLedNames[]` / `srMap[]` — ECM panel LEDs via 74HC595

Joystick button numbers are auto-assigned at runtime in this order: `switches[]` (38) → `analogBtnArrays[]` (8) → `encoders[]` (12, 2 each: CW then CCW) = **58 buttons**.

⚠ Inserting a switch anywhere but the end of `switches[]` renumbers every button after it, which invalidates existing BMS bindings. Append to the end of the array when adding hardware.

### What Cannot Go on the MCP23017

This constraint drives the whole pin layout:

| Signal | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| 74HC595 control (3 pins) | 32-bit shift via I2C would take ~38ms — exceeds the loop budget |
| Resistor ladder | MCP23017 has no ADC |
| Rotary encoders | Need interrupt-rate sampling; I2C polling drops pulses |
| Potentiometers | MCP23017 has no ADC |

Everything else (29 switches, 11 ELEC/EPU LEDs) rides the 2-wire I2C bus.

### Switch Types

- `SW_ON_OFF` — 1 pin, 1 button
- `SW_ON_OFF_ON` — 2 pins, 2 buttons (center = both off)
- `SW_ROTARY` — `numPos` consecutive pins from `pin1`, `numPos` buttons (one active at a time). Used for UHF FUNCTION (4), UHF MODE (3), and AUDIO 1 COMM 1/COMM 2 MODE (3 each).

### Rotary Encoders

Six encoders on the UHF panel. A 1kHz `IntervalTimer` ISR (`encoderPollISR`) runs the quadrature state machine; the main loop drains detent deltas straight into a signed pulse queue and emits DX button pulses one at a time. The sketch does not track an absolute value — digit wrap and range limits (e.g., the 100MHz digit is only 2–3) are BMS's job, and BMS simply ignores pulses past a limit.

- `ENC_PULSE_TICKS` (4) — pulse held ~40ms at 100Hz, then a 1-tick gap before the next
- `ENC_PENDING_MAX` (30) — queue cap so fast spinning doesn't lag indefinitely

Encoders never appear in `prevBtnState` change detection; they set `lastInputTime` directly.

### Resistor Ladder — Nearest-Value Matching

The ECM PCB is fixed (10kΩ chain + 20kΩ pulldown), and its top values sit only 28 counts apart. `processAnalogButtons()` therefore picks the **closest** value rather than testing tolerance windows, which makes overlapping windows structurally impossible. Combined with 8× oversampling (~±2 counts of noise), the worst pair (FRM/SPL) keeps a ±14 count margin.

`maxDist` rejects readings that match nothing (idle ADC ≈ 0).

> Values are calibrated for **10-bit** ADC. Switching to `analogReadResolution(12)` requires scaling `ecmBtnValues[]` and `maxDist` by 4.

### MCP23017 Output Batching

`mcpWritePin()` only updates a cached port byte and sets a dirty flag; `mcpFlushOutputs()` writes each changed port once per loop. All 8 ELEC LEDs live on the GPB port of `0x21`, so a full LED update costs **one** I2C write instead of eight.

LEDs are sourced (cathode common to GND), so the binding limit is **VDD inflow 125mA**, not the VSS 150mA figure. `0x21` carries 11 LEDs (ELEC 8 + EPU 3) — keep each at or below **10mA** (11 × 10 = 110mA).

### Protocol Auto-Detection

- **BMS-BIOS**: sync `0xAA 0xBB`, 11-byte frames (ledBits 4 + srData 4 + XOR). `BiosHandler/BmsBiosParser.h`
- **DCS-BIOS**: sync `0x55 ×4`, address/count/data chunks. `BiosHandler/DcsBiosParser.h`
- 3-second heartbeat timeout triggers protocol reset and re-detection
- All LEDs off when the bridge goes offline

`ledBits` bit 16 carries the backlight state (same bit as the LEFT_AUX_MISC device — the bridge sends one unified frame format to every Teensy). DCS uses `LIGHT_INST_PNL` (0x4484).

### Backlight

ON/OFF only, no dimming. A Teensy pin drives a MOSFET gate — pin 13 on both stages (the on-board LED mirrors backlight state). Powered by a **separate 12V adapter**, not USB — the adapter GND must be tied to Teensy GND at a single point or the MOSFET has no valid gate reference.

Turns off on USB suspend and after `IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` (30 min) of no input while offline; any input or bridge reconnect restores it.

### USB Suspend Detection

SOF-based via `USB1_FRINDEX`. No frame change for 50ms → suspended. All LEDs and backlight off, CPU enters `wfi`. On resume the welcome ceremony runs at the next input change.

## Conventions

- Mixed Korean (comments/docs) and English (code/identifiers)
- Switch wiring: active-low with `INPUT_PULLUP` (pressed = LOW = logical ON)
- MCP pin numbering: GPA0–7 = 0–7, GPB0–7 = 8–15
- New switch: add to `switches[]`. New encoder: `encoders[]`. New pot: `pots[]` + a free `JoyAxis`
- New ELEC LED: `leds[]` + `LedIdx` enum. New ECM LED: `ecmSrLedNames[]` + `srMap[]`
- Extreme joystick (`JOYSTICK_SIZE 64`) exposes 6 named axes **plus `slider(1..17)`** — 23 analog channels total, not 6

## Constraints to Watch

- **74HC595 is at 32/32.** Adding a chip overflows the BMS-BIOS `srData` 32-bit field and requires changing `BB_FRAME_PAYLOAD`, both `BmsBiosParser.h` files, and `bmsbios_bridge.py`.
- **Peak current**: `welcomeCeremony()` lights all 32 SR LEDs plus every entry in `leds[]` (8 ELEC + 3 EPU + JFS RUN) at once. Two separate ceilings apply, and the tighter one is not USB:
  - **Teensy 3.3V regulator (~250mA, PJRC guidance)** — the 74HC595s and all MCP23017s are fed from this single rail, so full illumination (~430mA) exceeds it. A USB 3.0 port does not help. Stagger the blink phase, or move the '595s to **74HCT595 on 5V/Vin** (HCT's VIH is 2.0V, so 3.3V logic still drives it; recalculate the LED series resistors).
  - **USB 2.0 port (500mA)** — the ~548mA total peak also exceeds this.
  - **74HC595 package (~70mA/chip)** — normal operation lights 2 of 8 outputs per chip (~20mA), but the ceremony and the `ALL_LIT` ECM state light all 8.
- **Teensy pin 13** is shared with the on-board LED. As an *output* that is its native role — both stages use it for the backlight MOSFET, so the LED mirrors backlight state. Avoid using it as an *input*: the LED path can pull it below VIH and make it read permanently pressed.
